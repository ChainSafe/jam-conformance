# JAM Conformance Testing Material

This repository serves as a scratchpad for JAM protocol conformance testing
materials, including:

- Fuzzer reports 
- PVM execution traces
- Protocol conformance discussions and issues

While this may assist implementations in achieving protocol compliance,**THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL AUDITING PROCESS**

## Repository Structure

- `fuzz-proto` - Fuzzer protocol specification
- `fuzz-reports` - Fuzzing test results
- `pvm-traces` - PVM execution traces and logs scratchpad

## Related Resources

- [Official JAM Test Vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors) - Officially released test vectors
- [JAM Test Vectors (Release Candidate)](https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors) - Development test vectors

## Purpose

This repository facilitates JAM protocol implementation testing and
validation by providing a centralized location for test artifacts, enabling
cross-implementation comparison and protocol conformance verification.
