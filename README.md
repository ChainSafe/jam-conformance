# JAM Conformance Testing Material

This repository serves as a scratchpad for JAM protocol conformance testing
materials, including:

- Fuzzer reports 
- PVM execution traces
- Protocol conformance discussions and issues

While this may assist implementations in achieving protocol compliance,**THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL AUDITING PROCESS**

## Latest Updates

For the latest updates and announcements, see [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) which contains
information about new tools, discoveries, and improvements to the conformance
testing infrastructure.

## Repository Content

- [fuzz-proto](./fuzz-proto) - Fuzzer protocol specification
- [fuzz-reports](./fuzz-reports) - Fuzzing test reports
- [pvm-traces](./pvm-traces) - PVM execution traces scratchpad

## Purpose

This repository facilitates JAM protocol implementation testing and
validation by providing a centralized location for test artifacts, enabling
cross-implementation comparison and protocol conformance verification.
