Removed problematic reports from `archive`: 1754582958 1754725568 1754754058

From now on, I will not continuously ping teams in their issue when new reports
are available. It is the team's responsibility to check their folder for any
new reports. Please leave a comment in the issue when an outstending report is
sorted/analyzed, including the reason for the failure. This reason will be added
to the archived report to help other teams and to speed up troubleshooting of
potential regressions. I will double-check the fix before moving the report to
the archive.
